[![Publish dist](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml)

A **marketplace system for Claude Code plugins** — enabling discovery, distribution, and installation of AI-powered plugins that extend Claude's capabilities across code review, planning, testing, git workflows, accessibility, and more.

**Marketplace:** `agentics-kit` v4.0.0 · **12 plugins** · Requires Claude Code 1.0.33+ · [View all plugins](#plugin-reference-table) · [Browse docs](https://shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics/)

> **Breaking change — v4.0.0:** Six plugins have been removed from the marketplace: `agent-creator`, `agent-reviewer`, `agentic-plugin-dev`, `code-simplifier`, `marketplace-builder`, and `react-perf-analyzer`. Their source directories have been removed from the repository and are recoverable from git history at the commit preceding their deletion. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

> **Built for Claude, with Claude Code:** These plugins depend on the underlying Claude Code runtime, its agents, and its API — they are not standalone tools and will not work outside the Claude Code environment.

## Quick Start

**Install from the marketplace (no cloning required):**

```
# 1. Register the agentics-kit marketplace in Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit

# 2. Install the plugins you want
/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit
/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install memory-tools@agentics-kit
```

**Or load any plugin directly for local testing:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review
# Then ask: "Review this code for issues"
```

---

## Overview

The agentics project serves two purposes:

| Purpose | What it contains |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Active Plugins** | 12 marketplace plugins in `kit/plugins/` — installable via `/plugin install`, covering code review, planning, testing, git workflows, accessibility, and more |
| **Marketplace Infrastructure** | `agentics-kit` marketplace manifest (`marketplace.json`) that enables installation via `/plugin install` |

Every plugin in this repo is a working, production-quality tool you can install and use immediately.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Claude Code CLI** version 1.0.33 or later

```bash
# Verify version
claude --version
```

Install from the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation) if not present.

### Optional

- **Git** — for cloning the repository locally
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — used by the `git-agent` plugin for GitHub PR creation
- **GitLab CLI (`glab`)** — used by `agent-ship` for GitLab MR creation
- **`jq`** — JSON processor, useful for debugging plugin manifests

### Platform Support

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| macOS 12.0+ | Full support |
| Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) | Full support |
| Windows (WSL2) | Recommended over native Windows |

## Installation

### Install via Marketplace (Recommended)

The marketplace approach uses sparse cloning — only the plugin you install is fetched, not the entire repository.

**Step 1: Register the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit
```

**Step 2: Install individual plugins**

```
/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit
/plugin install plan-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install memory-tools@agentics-kit
/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit
/plugin install code-testing-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install wcag-compliance-reviewer@agentics-kit
/plugin install settings-sync@agentics-kit
/plugin install social-media-tools@agentics-kit
/plugin install team-defaults@agentics-kit
/plugin install artifact-tools@agentics-kit
/plugin install content-tools@agentics-kit
```

**Or install all at once** — paste the full block above into your Claude Code session.

### Auto-enable for Your Team (Declarative Config)

Instead of every contributor running `/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install` for each plugin, you can declare the kit once in `settings.json` using two keys: `extraKnownMarketplaces` (makes Claude Code aware of the marketplace) and `enabledPlugins` (marks which plugins should be enabled by default).

This repo ships these keys in **project scope** (`.claude/settings.json`). On first use, Claude Code prompts the user to trust the repo and add the marketplace; once added, the listed plugins are enabled by default — no per-plugin install commands. To enable the same kit across **all your other repos**, add the two keys to your personal **user settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "agentics-kit": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "shawn-sandy/agentics-kit" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "memory-tools@agentics-kit": true,
    "code-review@agentics-kit": true,
    "wcag-compliance-reviewer@agentics-kit": true,
    "skill-reviewer@agentics-kit": true,
    "code-testing-agent@agentics-kit": true,
    "git-agent@agentics-kit": true,
    "settings-sync@agentics-kit": true,
    "social-media-tools@agentics-kit": true,
    "plan-agent@agentics-kit": true,
    "team-defaults@agentics-kit": true,
    "artifact-tools@agentics-kit": true,
    "content-tools@agentics-kit": true
  }
}
```

> This config lives in `settings.json`, **not** `CLAUDE.md`. `enabledPlugins` is an object (`"name@agentics-kit": true`), not an array. Merge these keys into any existing settings rather than overwriting the file.

> **Heads-up on first run and web sessions:** the marketplace add is gated by a one-time trust/consent prompt. In a non-interactive context (such as a fresh Claude Code on the web session that can't answer prompts or run `/plugin`), the kit may not load until that prompt is accepted. If a session doesn't pick up the plugins, accept the trust prompt or run `/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit` once.

See the full team setup guide — including scope choices and caveats — in [docs/plugin-auto-load-setup.md](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/blob/main/docs/plugin-auto-load-setup.md).

### Load Locally for Testing

Clone the repo and load any plugin directly with `--plugin-dir`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit

# Load a single plugin (starts an interactive Claude session)
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review

# Load multiple plugins simultaneously
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/plan-agent \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent

# Or run with a prompt directly (non-interactive)
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review "Review this file for bugs"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### `claude: command not found`

Claude Code CLI is not installed or not in your `PATH`.

- Install from: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation
- Verify: `claude --version` — need 1.0.33+
- macOS/Linux: ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`
- Windows: use WSL2 and follow the Linux steps

#### Plugin not loading

The path may be wrong or the manifest may be missing.

```bash
# Verify the plugin directory exists and has a manifest
ls -la ./kit/plugins/code-review/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

# Use an absolute path if relative paths don't work
claude --plugin-dir /full/path/to/agentics/kit/plugins/code-review
```

#### Permission errors

```bash
ls -la ./kit/plugins/code-review
chmod -R +r ./kit/plugins/code-review
```

#### "Input must be provided" error with `--plugin-dir`

This occurs when Claude Code can't start the interactive session. Try:

```bash
# Provide a prompt directly
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review "List available commands"

# Or pipe stdin
echo "Review this code" | claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review

# Verify manifest is valid JSON
cat kit/plugins/code-review/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | jq
```

## Usage Guide

### Commands vs Skills vs Agents vs Hooks

Plugins can include four types of components:

| Type | Invocation | Example | Use When |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Commands** | Explicit: `/plugin:name` | `/plan-agent:deep-grill plan.md` | User controls exactly when it runs |
| **Skills** | Automatic: matches your intent | "Review this code for bugs" | Claude detects the need from conversation |
| **Agents** | Delegated: spawned as subprocesses | Background git commit | Work should run without blocking |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven: lifecycle triggers | Pre-commit filename validation | Actions must happen automatically |

Most plugins use **skills** (automatic activation). Ask naturally and Claude activates the right skill.

### Single Plugin

```bash
# Start an interactive session with a plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent

# Inside the session, use naturally:
# "Commit my changes with a conventional message"
# "Create a PR for this branch"
# /git-agent:ship-bg
```

### Multiple Plugins

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/plan-agent

# All skills and commands from all three plugins are available
```

Use `/help` inside any Claude session to list all active commands.

---

## Plugins

### Code Quality

---

#### `code-review`

Systematic code review across quality, bugs, security, and best practices with severity-ranked findings, actionable feedback, and line numbers.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/code-review:fix-branch` | Review all branch changes vs the default branch, then autonomously fix blocking, major, and minor issues until the branch is clean. Refuses on a dirty working tree. Leaves fixes uncommitted. |

**Skills** (activate automatically):

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `code-review-agent` | Review code, check files for problems, look over a PR or diff, assess quality or complexity, find bugs or security issues, detect breaking changes, or evaluate regression risk |

**Agents:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agent-code-reviewer` | Internal background code review agent for delegation from other agents or automated workflows |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review
# "Review this function for security issues"
# "Check for breaking changes in my last commit"
# /code-review:fix-branch
```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/code-review/README.md)

---

### Testing

---

#### `code-testing-agent`

Analyze code and suggest specific, purpose-driven tests tied to actual behavior and intent — not arbitrary coverage.

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `code-testing-agent` | Suggest tests, identify what to test, or find untested behavior |
| `reviewing-tests` | Review tests, audit test quality, or improve a test suite |
| `running-tests` | Run tests, check if tests pass, or verify changes |
| `tdd-fix` | TDD-fix a bug or run a red-green cycle — manual invoke only |
| `tdd-loop` | TDD a new feature or write tests first — manual invoke only |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-testing-agent
# "What tests should I write for this function?"
# "Review my test suite for gaps"
# "TDD fix this bug — write a failing test then make it green"
```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/code-testing-agent/README.md)

---

### Planning

---

#### `plan-agent`

Plan creation and review on demand or via ambient activation. Run `/plan-agent:implementation-plan <objective>` for the full Steps 0–8 planning workflow with a built-in structured interview; it authors the plan and stops, never writing source files. Implement a plan that already exists with `/plan-agent:build [<plan>]`, which walks the steps, ticks the spec, re-renders, and owns all three completion gates — acceptance criteria, end-to-end verification, and completion checklist. Turn a vague idea into a decision-complete proposal — saved as a copy-pasteable prompt under `docs/prompts/` — with `/plan-agent:build-proposal`, spawn a ten-reviewer Agent Team with `/plan-agent:review-plan`, finalize and mark plans completed with `/plan-agent:finalize-plan`, generate Anthropic-best-practice AI prompts with `/plan-agent:prompt`, scaffold GitHub Pages publishing with `/plan-agent:setup-sites`, or turn a completed plan or one-line idea into a runnable, framework-free static-HTML prototype with `/plan-agent:prototype`. Accepts GitHub/GitLab issue URLs and `#n` references to auto-seed plans. Generates self-contained interactive HTML plans with copy-paste implement prompts and optional workflow prompts for complex plans. PostToolUse hooks auto-regenerate the plans and prototypes gallery indexes; a filename hook enforces verb-target kebab-case.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan-agent:fix <objective>` | Author and implement a fix plan — the `/plan-agent:build` chain, typed as a fix |
| `/plan-agent:refactor <objective>` | Author and implement a refactor plan — the `/plan-agent:build` chain, typed as a refactor |
| `/plan-agent:review-plan-bg <path>` | Run the ten-reviewer plan-review Agent Team in the background — validates the path, spawns `agent-review-plan`, and returns an ack immediately |
| `/plan-agent:deep-grill [plan-file-path]` | Walk each decision branch in a plan with focused questions and codebase exploration |
| `/plan-agent:plan-status [plan-file-path] [--all]` | Check and update a plan's lifecycle status (todo, in-progress, completed) and type, one file or in bulk |
| `/plan-agent:documenting-plans [plan-file-path]` | Generate developer-friendly documentation at `docs/<slug>.md` from a completed plan |
| `/plan-agent:markdown-to-html [file-path] [--theme=…] [--mode=…]` | Convert a markdown file or plan to a rich, self-contained HTML document |
| `/plan-agent:prompt [intent] [--out <path>] [--answers-gathered]` | Build a structured AI prompt and save it to the prompts directory |
| `/plan-agent:plan-maintenance [--archive] [--index] [--variants] [--all]` | Archive completed plans as HTML, generate a README index, and review variant/duplicate files |

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `implementation-plan` | Create a plan via `/plan-agent:implementation-plan <objective>` — also auto-activates on plan-document intent |
| `build` | Implement a plan that already exists via `/plan-agent:build [<plan>]` — walks its steps, ticks the spec, re-renders, and runs the acceptance-criteria, end-to-end-verification, and completion-checklist gates; also auto-activates on "implement the plan at …" intent |
| `build-feature` | Turn a feature idea into a team feature doc that splits into sized, dependency-ordered sub-features, each of which becomes its own plan |
| `build-fleet` | Ship a backlog of plans in parallel — one isolated worktree agent per plan, each building its plan, opening a PR, and watching CI |
| `build-proposal` | Turn a vague idea into a decision-complete proposal, saved as a copy-pasteable prompt (`docs/prompts/proposal-<slug>.md`) authored by delegating to `prompt` — researches web + codebase, separates facts from decisions, then hands off to `implementation-plan`; also writes the deprecated `docs/proposals/<slug>.md` copy through 6.0.x; auto-activates on idea / "should-we" / compare-and-align intent |
| `review-plan` | Spawn a ten-reviewer Agent Team (architecture, completeness, testability, risk, conventions, product, security, + UI-conditional UX, accessibility, and frontend) to review a plan, synthesize findings, and apply improvements in place |
| `finalize-plan` | Review a plan for completion evidence with per-criterion verification and mark it completed — manual invoke only |
| `prompt` | Generate a copy-pasteable AI prompt grounded in Anthropic best practices (role, XML structure, CoT, examples) across five types (`system`, `task`, `creative`, `analytical`, `proposal`) — command only, with a `commands/prompt.md` wrapper so other skills can reach it |
| `setup-sites` | Scaffold the GitHub Pages deploy pipeline (workflow, `.nojekyll`, landing hub, preview script) into any repo so `docs/` HTML publishes to a public URL — command (`/plan-agent:setup-sites`) or auto-activates on "set up / publish GitHub Pages" intent |
| `prototype` | Turn a completed HTML plan or a one-line idea into a runnable, framework-free static-HTML prototype under `docs/prototypes/` (inline JSON seed + per-prototype `localStorage`, escaped output, a11y baked in) — command (`/plan-agent:prototype <plan.html \| idea>`) or auto-activates on "prototype this plan / idea" intent |
| `plans-library` | Browse plans, view plan history, or open the plans index |
| `plans-open` | Reopen the plans gallery without rebuilding |
| `deep-grill` | Deep-grill or stress-test a plan decision by decision — manual invoke only |
| `documenting-plans` | Document a completed plan into `docs/<slug>.md` — manual invoke only |
| `markdown-to-html` | Convert a markdown file or plan to HTML |
| `plan-status` | Check or update a plan's lifecycle status, one file or a whole directory |

**Agents:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agent-review-plan` | Background plan-review agent — invokes the `review-plan` skill with `--background` and reports the updated path on completion |
| `plan-reviewer-architecture` · `-completeness` · `-testability` · `-risk` · `-conventions` · `-product` · `-security` | Seven core reviewer teammates, always spawned by the Agent Team |
| `plan-reviewer-ux` · `-accessibility` · `-frontend` | Three UI-conditional reviewer teammates, spawned when UI signals are detected |
| `plan-documenter` | Batch documentation agent — scans the plans directory for completed plans with no `docs/` counterpart and runs `documenting-plans` on each |

> The `review-plan` Agent Team requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` and Claude Code ≥ 2.1.32.

**Hooks:**

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `validate-plan-filename` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit) | Enforces verb-target kebab-case filenames on plan files |
| `rebuild-plans-index` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Auto-regenerates the plans gallery index when plans change |
| `build-prototypes-index` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Auto-regenerates the prototypes gallery index when `docs/prototypes/` changes |
| `render-plan-html` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Re-renders a plan's HTML after its source changes |
| `check-prototype-drift` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Warns when a prototype has drifted from the plan it was generated from |
| Stress-test nudge | `PostToolUse` (ExitPlanMode) | Suggests running the Step 5b interview or the `review-plan` team before implementing |

> All five Write/Edit hooks are registered through a single `hooks/dispatch.py` entry rather than five matchers, which is why the reference table counts two registrations.

### Git & Workflow

---

#### `git-agent`

Automated git workflow — create branches, commit with conventional messages, create PRs, and merge them once they are green. Auto-links plan issue references in PR descriptions. By default, every PR-opening flow (`pr-agent`, `ship`, and their background agents) runs an adversarial review of `git diff <base>...HEAD` against a six-point checklist before the PR is created; `ship --no-review` skips this review.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/git-agent:commit-bg` | Fire off the agent-commit subagent in the background to stage and commit the working tree, then return control immediately |
| `/git-agent:pr-bg` | Fire off the agent-pr subagent in the background to push the current branch and open a GitHub PR, then return control immediately |
| `/git-agent:ship-bg` | Fire off the agent-ship subagent in the background to commit, push, and open a PR/MR end-to-end, then return control immediately |
| `/git-agent:ship-ci-bg` | Watch CI on an already-open PR in the background, apply at most one deterministic autofix per failure class (which it commits and pushes), and report — without blocking the session |
| `/git-agent:merge-bg` | Squash-merge one fully green PR in the background — dispatching the command *is* the approval; anything ambiguous comes back as a report instead of a merge |

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `branch-agent` | Create or start a new branch — manual invoke only |
| `commit-agent` | Commit or save work to git — manual invoke only |
| `create-issue` | File, open, or create a GitHub or GitLab issue from any context — detects the host from the git remote and confirms before creating |
| `pr-agent` | Create a PR or open a pull request — manual invoke only |
| `merge` | Merge a PR — checks `MERGEABLE`, green checks, and the lint gate, then merges only with explicit approval; never passes `--delete-branch`. Typing `merge?` routes here deterministically |
| `post-merge-cleanup` | Clear away a merged branch and its worktree — detects squash-merges, inspects the worktree for uncommitted work first, and asks before every destructive step |
| `ship` | Ship changes or commit and create a PR — manual invoke only |
| `ship-autonomous` | Autonomously ship or watch CI — runs the full ship pipeline with CI polling and bounded autofix |

**Agents:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agent-commit` | Background git commit agent — stages all working-tree changes and creates a conventional commit message without user interaction |
| `agent-pr` | Background pull-request creation agent — pushes the current branch if needed and opens a GitHub pull request with an auto-generated summary |
| `agent-ship` | Background end-to-end ship agent — stages, commits, pushes, and opens a pull/merge request in one autonomous flow |
| `agent-ship-ci` | Background CI watcher — polls checks on an open PR until they settle, applies deterministic autofixes as their own commits (refusing to run on a dirty tree), and reports pass/fail |
| `agent-merge` | Background merge agent — squash-merges a single green PR, or returns a report when readiness is ambiguous |

**Hooks:**

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `merge-shorthand` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Routes a bare `merge?` prompt to the `merge` skill instead of leaving it to intent matching |
| `lint-before-commit` | `PreToolUse` (Bash) | Runs the repo's lint gate before a `git commit` lands, so a failing lint blocks the commit rather than CI |
| `scope-guard` | `PreToolUse` (Bash) | Blocks git commands that would reach outside the branch's intended scope |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent
# "Commit my changes"
# "Create a branch for this feature"
# "Ship it"
# merge?
# /git-agent:ship-bg
# /git-agent:merge-bg
```

```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/wcag-compliance-reviewer/README.md)

---

### Plugin Development

---

#### `skill-reviewer`

#### `memory-tools`

Audit and reshape Claude Code project memory — CLAUDE.md files, path-scoped rule files in `.claude/rules/`, and usage-insights follow-through.

**Skills** (activate automatically):

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `agentic-memory-management` | Audit, optimize, or diagnose a CLAUDE.md or project memory file — also activates when Claude appears to be ignoring project instructions |
| `path-rules-advisor` | Create path-specific rules, add rules for file types or directories, or organize Claude rules in `.claude/rules/` |
| `implementing-insights` | Implement the findings from a usage-insights report — triages every recommendation against existing config, discovers target repos from `~/.claude/projects/`, and implements only the genuinely open items, one PR per repo change |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/memory-tools
# "Audit my CLAUDE.md file"
# "Claude keeps ignoring my instructions — what's wrong?"
# "Create path-specific rules for my src/ directory"
# "Implement the findings from this insights report"
```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/social-media-tools/README.md)

---

#### `artifact-tools`

Publish work as live claude.ai artifacts. Every skill runs a blocking `security-scrub` gate before publishing and falls back to local HTML when publishing is unavailable.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/artifact-tools:eng-recap` | Publish an engineering recap of this session or a pull request — architecture, code paths, tradeoffs, learnings, tests, and review follow-ups, written for the engineer who touches this code next |
| `/artifact-tools:team-recap` | Publish a detailed, visual recap for the whole team — diagrams, before/after, decisions, and open items, readable by engineers and non-engineers alike |
| `/artifact-tools:product-doc` | Publish a recap for the product team and stakeholders — features, fixes, decisions, and plan details |

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |

| `diff-artifact` | Publish or share a diff — builds an annotated walkthrough (branch, commit range, or PR) with a sticky file sidebar, per-hunk reviewer notes, and severity labels |
| `plan-artifact` | Publish or share a plan — republishes to the same URL across sessions via `artifact-url:` frontmatter so viewers watch steps check off live |
| `prompt-artifact` | Publish or share a prompt saved by `plan-agent:prompt` — one prompt, or the whole filterable library with `--library` |
| `session-artifact` | Share a session recap — extracts transcript turns into Summary, Decisions, Learnings, and Files touched |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/artifact-tools
# "Publish this diff as an artifact"
# "Share a recap of this session"
```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/artifact-tools/README.md)

---

#### `content-tools`

Turn work products into publishable site content. Every site-specific value comes from a project-root `CONTENT.md`, and a blocking `security-scrub` gate runs before any write.

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `artifact-to-post` | Turn a local HTML artifact, pasted HTML, or a Markdown file into a **draft** post for a static site (Astro first) — each block takes the highest rung of the fidelity ladder that holds, and an MDX-safety pass runs after the prose rewrite. claude.ai artifact URLs are refused with a pointer to `social-media-tools:save-artifact` |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/content-tools
# "Turn this artifact into a blog post draft"
```

[View Documentation](./kit/plugins/content-tools/README.md)

---

#### `team-defaults`

Shared team defaults — bundled rules plus two authoring agents.

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `sync-rules` | Install the bundled team rules (plan-mode, component-driven-ui, typescript-jsdoc, review-bot-loops) into `~/.claude/rules/` with per-file confirmation |

**Agents:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ts-commenter` | Adds or standardizes JSDoc on TypeScript files, optimized for AI-assistant readability |
| `css-generator` | Extracts design tokens from images into CSS custom properties and utility classes |

## Removed Plugins

The following plugins have been removed from the `agentics-kit` marketplace — six at v4.0.0, one absorbed into `git-agent`, and two folded into `plan-agent` since. They **will not appear** when browsing or installing from the marketplace — `/plugin install` will not find them.

Their source directories have been removed from the repository. De-registering a plugin stops distribution but not loading — a directory left under `kit/plugins/` still loads via `--plugin-dir`, collides by name with a live plugin, and consumes skill-description budget in every session. Git history is the reference, so the source is recoverable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit
git log --diff-filter=D --oneline -- kit/plugins/<plugin-name>
git checkout <commit>^ -- kit/plugins/<plugin-name>
```

| Plugin | Last Version | Removed | Reason | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `product-plans` | 3.4.13 | 2026-08-02 | Folded into `plan-agent` 8.2.0 — its PM, security, and frontend lenses now ship as `plan-reviewer-product`, `-security`, and `-frontend` inside `review-plan` | `/plugin install plan-agent@agentics-kit` then `/plan-agent:review-plan` |
| `plan-interview` | 3.0.0 | 2026-07-17 | Merged into `plan-agent` 4.0.0 — `documenting-plans`, `markdown-to-html`, `plan-status`, `plan-maintenance`, `deep-grill`, and the ExitPlanMode nudge all carried over | `/plugin install plan-agent@agentics-kit` |
| `issue-agent` | 0.2.4 | 2026-06-16 | Absorbed into `git-agent` v3.11.0 to reduce plugin count | `/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit` then `/git-agent:create-issue` |
| `agent-creator` | 1.1.2 | 2026-05-29 | Redundant with `agentic-plugin-dev` | No replacement — removed from the marketplace |
| `agent-reviewer` | 1.0.2 | 2026-05-29 | Overlaps with `skill-reviewer` | `/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit` |
| `marketplace-builder` | 1.1.2 | 2026-05-29 | Redundant with `agentic-plugin-dev` | No replacement — removed from the marketplace |
| `react-perf-analyzer` | 1.3.1 | 2026-05-29 | Too specialized for React-only projects | `/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit` |
| `agentic-plugin-dev` | 1.2.2 | 2026-05-29 | Functionality consolidated into existing skills | `/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit` |
| `code-simplifier` | 1.0.2 | 2026-05-29 | Structural analysis covered by `code-review` | `/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit` |

**To recover a removed plugin's source:**

Their directories are no longer in the working tree. Restore one from git history if you need it for reference:

```bash
# Find the commit that deleted it, then restore that path from its parent
git log --diff-filter=D --oneline -- kit/plugins/agent-creator
git checkout <commit>^ -- kit/plugins/agent-creator
```

> Re-registering any of these plugins in `marketplace.json` requires explicit confirmation — see the [Removed Plugins registry](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/blob/main/.claude/rules/marketplace.md) for the removal rationale before proceeding.

## Contributing

### Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/issues/new) with:

- Plugin name and version
- Claude Code CLI version (`claude --version`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages or screenshots

### Creating a New Plugin

**Step 1: Scaffold the directory structure**

```
kit/plugins/my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: name, description (NO version field)
├── commands/                 # Slash commands — optional
│   └── my-command.md
├── skills/                   # Auto-activated skills — optional
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── agents/                   # Background subagent definitions — optional
│   └── my-agent.md
└── README.md
```

**Step 2: Create the plugin manifest**

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "What this plugin does"
}
```

> **Version rule:** `version` belongs **only** in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Adding it to `plugin.json` silently overrides the marketplace version and causes conflicts.

**Step 3: Test locally**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/my-plugin

# Inside the session, test your commands/skills:
# /my-plugin:my-command
# "Invoke my-plugin on this file"
```

**Step 4: Register in the marketplace**

Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "git-subdir",
    "url": "https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics.git",
    "path": "kit/plugins/my-plugin"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "category": "development",
  "tags": ["specific", "relevant", "tags"]
}
```

**Available categories:** `development` · `testing` · `productivity` · `security` · `documentation` · `learning`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Build and test your plugin locally with `--plugin-dir`
3. Bump the plugin's `version` in `marketplace.json` (must be higher than `main`)
4. Include the relevant plan file from `docs/plans/` in your commit
5. Submit a PR with a clear description

**PR Checklist:**

- [ ] `plugin.json` has `name` and `description` — **no `version` field**
- [ ] Version bumped in `marketplace.json` and higher than version on `main`
- [ ] Plugin tested locally with `claude --plugin-dir`
- [ ] `README.md` included in plugin directory
- [ ] Homepage URL points to the plugin directory: `https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/tree/main/kit/plugins/my-plugin`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated (for existing plugins)
- [ ] Plan file committed alongside changes

### Versioning

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| **PATCH** `x.y.Z` | Bug fix, typo, metadata correction |
| **MINOR** `x.Y.z` | New command, skill, agent, or hook added |
| **MAJOR** `X.y.z` | Removing/renaming a command/skill/agent, changing argument format |

**Commit message conventions:**

```
fix(kit/plugins/my-plugin): bump version to 1.0.1     # patch
feat(kit/plugins/my-plugin): bump version to 1.1.0    # minor
feat(kit/plugins/my-plugin)!: bump version to 2.0.0   # major
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

## Development

### Authoring Rules

Detailed patterns live in `.claude/rules/`:

| File | Scope | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| `plugin-patterns.md` | `kit/plugins/**` | Command/skill patterns, progressive disclosure, pitfalls |
| `marketplace.md` | `kit/plugins/**`, `.claude-plugin/**` | Categories, tagging, versioning, registration |
| `testing.md` | `tests/**` | Test fixture guidelines |
| `plan-hygiene.md` | `**/plans/**` | Pre-commit plan file rename checks |
| `skill-authoring.md` | `kit/plugins/**/skills/**` | Skill description format, `allowed-tools`, trigger phrases |
| `removed-plugins.md` | always (unscoped) | Registry of de-registered plugins; gates re-adding one behind explicit confirmation |

### Project Hooks (Auto-Active)

Two hooks run at `SessionStart`:

1. **Merge-driver registration** — runs `scripts/setup-merge-driver.sh` so `marketplace.json` and gallery `index.html` conflicts auto-resolve
2. **Base-branch refresh** — pulls or fetches the default branch so the session starts from current `origin`

Three more run after every file Write/Edit:

1. **JSON validation** — validates `marketplace.json` syntax
2. **Uncommitted plan warning** — alerts if plan files are unstaged alongside plugin changes
3. **Version guard** — when `marketplace.json` is dirty, runs `scripts/check-plugin-versions.mjs` to confirm every touched plugin's version exceeds `origin/main`

The version guard compares **committed** state (`origin/main...HEAD`), so it
catches an un-bumped commit on the next Write/Edit after you commit, not at the
moment you edit. It does not fetch, so it is only as current as your last
`git fetch`. Before pushing, run it directly against a fresh base:

```bash
git fetch origin && BASE_REF=main node scripts/check-plugin-versions.mjs
```

### Running Tests

`tests/run-all.sh` is the single entry point — it discovers every
`tests/**/test-*.sh`, `tests/**/test-*.mjs`, and `tests/**/*.test.mjs` file
automatically, so a new test needs no wiring. A short skip list at the top of the
script names the four suites that need a CLI, a deployment, or a built `dist/`,
each with its reason.

```bash
# Run everything
bash tests/run-all.sh
```

Individual suites still run on their own:

```bash
bash tests/demo/run.sh                    # demo suite
bash tests/pages/test-docs-hub.sh         # docs hub smoke test
bash tests/plugins/test-agent-frontmatter.sh
```

### Browsing Docs Online

The docs landing hub is deployed to GitHub Pages at [shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics](https://shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics/) and links to the Plans gallery and Social Media card gallery.

### Browsing Docs Locally

Two ways to serve the HTML galleries (`docs/plans/` and `docs/media/social/`) locally. The root `docs/index.html` is a landing hub with cards linking to each gallery:

**Script — auto-selects a free port:**

```bash
bash scripts/serve-docs.sh
# Plans gallery:  http://localhost:<port>/plans/
# Media library:  http://localhost:<port>/media/social/
```

Pass an explicit port as the first argument to pin it:

```bash
bash scripts/serve-docs.sh 8900
```

**Launch configs — auto-assigned ports (`.claude/launch.json`):**

Each config uses `autoPort: true`, so the preview harness binds a free port at start time (reported when the server launches) — no fixed port to collide with another running server.

| Config | Directory |
|--------|-----------|
| `plans-gallery` | `docs/plans/` |
| `media-library` | `docs/media/social/` |
| `docs-all` | `docs/` (landing hub at root) |

---

## Distribution

Plugin releases are published daily to [shawn-sandy/agentics-kit](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit) — a clean, plugin-only distribution repository containing only the installable plugin files with no development scaffolding, test fixtures, or internal tooling.

**Install from the distribution repo:**

```
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit
```

**Repository roles:**

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `shawn-sandy/agentics` | Development workspace — full source, tests, plans, CI, and authoring tooling |
| `shawn-sandy/agentics-kit` | Clean distribution — plugin files only, built and published by the daily publish workflow |

**Publish workflow:** [publish-dist.yml](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml) — runs daily and pushes the current `kit/plugins/` contents to `shawn-sandy/agentics-kit`.

**Trigger a manual publish:**

```bash
gh workflow run publish-dist.yml --repo shawn-sandy/agentics
```

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` mention in issues/PRs | Respond to questions and implement requested changes |
| `claude-code-review.yml` | PR opened / synchronized / reopened | Automated code review as PR comments |
| `deploy-pages.yml` | Push to `main` (docs changes) | Deploy `docs/` to GitHub Pages |
| `update-readme.yml` | Every Sunday at 00:00 UTC | Keep the README in sync with `marketplace.json` |
| `check-plugin-versions.yml` | Pull request | Fail the PR if a touched plugin's `marketplace.json` version does not exceed the base branch, and run the test suite |
| `publish-dist.yml` | Daily + manual dispatch | Build `dist/` and push it to the `shawn-sandy/agentics-kit` distribution repo |
| `regen-plans.yml` | Push to `main` (plan changes) | Re-render plan HTML and rebuild the plans gallery index |

To trigger Claude in any issue or PR comment, mention `@claude`:

```
@claude Can you review the skill descriptions in this plugin?
```
