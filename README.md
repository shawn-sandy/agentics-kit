# agentics

[![Publish dist](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml)

A **marketplace system for Claude Code plugins** — enabling discovery, distribution, and installation of AI-powered plugins that extend Claude's capabilities across code review, planning, testing, git workflows, accessibility, and more.

**Marketplace:** `agentics-kit` v4.0.0 · **12 plugins** · Requires Claude Code 1.0.33+ · [View all plugins](#plugin-reference-table) · [Browse docs](https://shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics/)

> **Breaking change — v4.0.0:** Six plugins have been removed from the marketplace: `agent-creator`, `agent-reviewer`, `agentic-plugin-dev`, `code-simplifier`, `marketplace-builder`, and `react-perf-analyzer`. Their source directories are retained in the repository but are no longer installable via the marketplace. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

> **Built for Claude, with Claude Code:** These plugins depend on the underlying Claude Code runtime, its agents, and its API — they are not standalone tools and will not work outside the Claude Code environment.

## Quick Start

**Install from the marketplace (no cloning required):**

```
# 1. Register the agentics-kit marketplace in Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit

# 2. Install the plugins you want
/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit
/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install memory-tools@agentics-kit
```

**Or load any plugin directly for local testing:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review
# Then ask: "Review this code for issues"
```

---

## Overview

The agentics project serves two purposes:

| Purpose | What it contains |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Active Plugins** | 12 marketplace plugins in `kit/plugins/` — installable via `/plugin install`, covering code review, planning, testing, git workflows, accessibility, and more |
| **Archived Plugins** | 6 removed plugins with source directories retained in `kit/plugins/` — loadable locally via `--plugin-dir` but not available via `/plugin install` |
| **Marketplace Infrastructure** | `agentics-kit` marketplace manifest (`marketplace.json`) that enables installation via `/plugin install` |

Every plugin in this repo is a working, production-quality tool you can install and use immediately.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Claude Code CLI** version 1.0.33 or later

```bash
# Verify version
claude --version
```

Install from the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation) if not present.

### Optional

- **Git** — for cloning the repository locally
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — used by the `git-agent` plugin for GitHub PR creation
- **GitLab CLI (`glab`)** — used by `agent-ship` for GitLab MR creation
- **`jq`** — JSON processor, useful for debugging plugin manifests

### Platform Support

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| macOS 12.0+ | Full support |
| Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) | Full support |
| Windows (WSL2) | Recommended over native Windows |

## Installation

### Install via Marketplace (Recommended)

The marketplace approach uses sparse cloning — only the plugin you install is fetched, not the entire repository.

**Step 1: Register the marketplace**

```
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit
```

**Step 2: Install individual plugins**

```
/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit
/plugin install plan-interview@agentics-kit
/plugin install memory-tools@agentics-kit
/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit
/plugin install code-testing-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install wcag-compliance-reviewer@agentics-kit
/plugin install product-plans@agentics-kit
/plugin install plan-agent@agentics-kit
/plugin install settings-sync@agentics-kit
/plugin install social-media-tools@agentics-kit
```

**Or install all at once** — paste the full block above into your Claude Code session.

### Auto-enable for Your Team (Declarative Config)

Instead of every contributor running `/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install` for each plugin, you can declare the kit once in `settings.json` using two keys: `extraKnownMarketplaces` (makes Claude Code aware of the marketplace) and `enabledPlugins` (marks which plugins should be enabled by default).

This repo ships these keys in **project scope** (`.claude/settings.json`). On first use, Claude Code prompts the user to trust the repo and add the marketplace; once added, the listed plugins are enabled by default — no per-plugin install commands. To enable the same kit across **all your other repos**, add the two keys to your personal **user settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "agentics-kit": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "shawn-sandy/agentics-kit" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "memory-tools@agentics-kit": true,
    "code-review@agentics-kit": true,
    "plan-interview@agentics-kit": true,
    "wcag-compliance-reviewer@agentics-kit": true,
    "skill-reviewer@agentics-kit": true,
    "code-testing-agent@agentics-kit": true,
    "git-agent@agentics-kit": true,
    "product-plans@agentics-kit": true,
    "settings-sync@agentics-kit": true,
    "social-media-tools@agentics-kit": true,
    "plan-agent@agentics-kit": true
  }
}
```

> This config lives in `settings.json`, **not** `CLAUDE.md`. `enabledPlugins` is an object (`"name@agentics-kit": true`), not an array. Merge these keys into any existing settings rather than overwriting the file.

> **Heads-up on first run and web sessions:** the marketplace add is gated by a one-time trust/consent prompt. In a non-interactive context (such as a fresh Claude Code on the web session that can't answer prompts or run `/plugin`), the kit may not load until that prompt is accepted. If a session doesn't pick up the plugins, accept the trust prompt or run `/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit` once.

See the full team setup guide — including scope choices and caveats — in [docs/plugin-auto-load-setup.md](./docs/plugin-auto-load-setup.md).

### Load Locally for Testing

Clone the repo and load any plugin directly with `--plugin-dir`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit

# Load a single plugin (starts an interactive Claude session)
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review

# Load multiple plugins simultaneously
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/plan-interview \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent

# Or run with a prompt directly (non-interactive)
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review "Review this file for bugs"
```

### Troubleshooting

#### `claude: command not found`

Claude Code CLI is not installed or not in your `PATH`.

- Install from: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation
- Verify: `claude --version` — need 1.0.33+
- macOS/Linux: ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`
- Windows: use WSL2 and follow the Linux steps

#### Plugin not loading

The path may be wrong or the manifest may be missing.

```bash
# Verify the plugin directory exists and has a manifest
ls -la ./kit/plugins/code-review/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

# Use an absolute path if relative paths don't work
claude --plugin-dir /full/path/to/agentics/kit/plugins/code-review
```

#### Permission errors

```bash
ls -la ./kit/plugins/code-review
chmod -R +r ./kit/plugins/code-review
```

#### "Input must be provided" error with `--plugin-dir`

This occurs when Claude Code can't start the interactive session. Try:

```bash
# Provide a prompt directly
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review "List available commands"

# Or pipe stdin
echo "Review this code" | claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review

# Verify manifest is valid JSON
cat kit/plugins/code-review/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | jq
```

## Usage Guide

### Commands vs Skills vs Agents vs Hooks

Plugins can include four types of components:

| Type | Invocation | Example | Use When |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Commands** | Explicit: `/plugin:name` | `/plan-interview:deep-grill plan.md` | User controls exactly when it runs |
| **Skills** | Automatic: matches your intent | "Review this code for bugs" | Claude detects the need from conversation |
| **Agents** | Delegated: spawned as subprocesses | Background git commit | Work should run without blocking |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven: lifecycle triggers | Pre-commit filename validation | Actions must happen automatically |

Most plugins use **skills** (automatic activation). Ask naturally and Claude activates the right skill.

### Single Plugin

```bash
# Start an interactive session with a plugin loaded
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent

# Inside the session, use naturally:
# "Commit my changes with a conventional message"
# "Create a PR for this branch"
# /git-agent:ship-bg
```

### Multiple Plugins

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/git-agent \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/plan-interview

# All skills and commands from all three plugins are available
```

Use `/help` inside any Claude session to list all active commands.

---

#### `plan-agent` v2.9.0

Plan creation and review on demand or via ambient activation. Run `/plan-agent:implementation-plan <objective>` for the full Steps 0–8 planning workflow with built-in structured interview, an end-to-end self-verification gate, and a mandatory acceptance-criteria gate during implementation. Turn a vague idea into a decision-complete proposal with `/plan-agent:build-proposal`, spawn a seven-reviewer Agent Team with `/plan-agent:review-plan`, finalize and mark plans completed with `/plan-agent:finalize-plan`, generate Anthropic-best-practice AI prompts with `/plan-agent:refine-prompt`, scaffold GitHub Pages publishing with `/plan-agent:setup-sites`, or turn a completed plan or one-line idea into a runnable, framework-free static-HTML prototype with `/plan-agent:prototype`. Accepts GitHub/GitLab issue URLs and `#n` references to auto-seed plans. Generates self-contained interactive HTML plans with copy-paste implement prompts and optional workflow prompts for complex plans. PostToolUse hooks auto-regenerate the plans and prototypes gallery indexes; a filename hook enforces verb-target kebab-case.

**Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan-agent:review-plan-bg <path>` | Run the seven-reviewer plan-review Agent Team in the background — validates the path, spawns `agent-review-plan`, and returns an ack immediately |

**Skills:**

| Skill | Activates when you ask to... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `implementation-plan` | Create a plan via `/plan-agent:implementation-plan <objective>` — also auto-activates on plan-document intent |
| `build-proposal` | Turn a vague idea into a decision-complete proposal (`docs/proposals/<slug>.md`) — researches web + codebase, separates facts from decisions, then hands off to `implementation-plan`; auto-activates on idea / "should-we" / compare-and-align intent |
| `review-plan` | Spawn a seven-reviewer Agent Team (architecture, completeness, testability, risk, conventions, + UI-conditional UX and accessibility) to review a plan, synthesize findings, and apply improvements in place |
| `finalize-plan` | Review a plan for completion evidence with per-criterion verification and mark it completed — manual invoke only |
| `refine-prompt` | Generate a copy-pasteable AI prompt grounded in Anthropic best practices (role, XML structure, CoT, examples) — command only |
| `setup-sites` | Scaffold the GitHub Pages deploy pipeline (workflow, `.nojekyll`, landing hub, preview script) into any repo so `docs/` HTML publishes to a public URL — command (`/plan-agent:setup-sites`) or auto-activates on "set up / publish GitHub Pages" intent |
| `prototype` | Turn a completed HTML plan or a one-line idea into a runnable, framework-free static-HTML prototype under `docs/prototypes/` (inline JSON seed + per-prototype `localStorage`, escaped output, a11y baked in) — command (`/plan-agent:prototype <plan.html \| idea>`) or auto-activates on "prototype this plan / idea" intent |
| `plans-library` | Browse plans, view plan history, or open the plans index |
| `plans-open` | Reopen the plans gallery without rebuilding |

**Agents:**

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agent-review-plan` | Background plan-review agent — invokes the `review-plan` skill with `--background` and reports the updated path on completion |
| `plan-reviewer-architecture` · `-completeness` · `-testability` · `-risk` · `-conventions` | Five core reviewer teammates, always spawned by the Agent Team |
| `plan-reviewer-ux` · `-accessibility` | Two UI-conditional reviewer teammates, spawned when UI signals are detected |

> The `review-plan` Agent Team requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` and Claude Code ≥ 2.1.32.

**Hooks:**

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `validate-plan-filename` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit) | Enforces verb-target kebab-case filenames on plan files |
| `rebuild-plans-index` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Auto-regenerates the plans gallery index when plans change |
| `build-prototypes-index` | `PostToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) | Auto-regenerates the prototypes gallery index when `docs/prototypes/` changes |

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/plan-agent
# /plan-agent:implementation-plan "Add dark mode support to the settings page"
# /plan-agent:implementation-plan https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42

## Removed Plugins

The following plugins have been removed from the `agentics-kit` marketplace as of v4.0.0. They **will not appear** when browsing or installing from the marketplace — `/plugin install` will not find them.

Their source directories are retained in the repository as reference implementations. You can still load any of them locally with `--plugin-dir`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit.git
cd agentics-kit
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/<plugin-name>
```

| Plugin | Last Version | Removed | Reason | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `issue-agent` | 0.2.4 | 2026-06-16 | Absorbed into `git-agent` v3.11.0 to reduce plugin count | `/plugin install git-agent@agentics-kit` then `/git-agent:create-issue` |
| [`agent-creator`](./kit/plugins/agent-creator) | 1.1.2 | 2026-05-29 | Redundant with `agentic-plugin-dev` | Use `agentic-plugin-dev` (also archived; see below) |
| [`agent-reviewer`](./kit/plugins/agent-reviewer) | 1.0.2 | 2026-05-29 | Overlaps with `skill-reviewer` | `/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit` |
| [`marketplace-builder`](./kit/plugins/marketplace-builder) | 1.1.2 | 2026-05-29 | Redundant with `agentic-plugin-dev` | Use `agentic-plugin-dev` (also archived; see below) |
| [`react-perf-analyzer`](./kit/plugins/react-perf-analyzer) | 1.3.1 | 2026-05-29 | Too specialized for React-only projects | `/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit` |
| [`agentic-plugin-dev`](./kit/plugins/agentic-plugin-dev) | 1.2.2 | 2026-05-29 | Functionality consolidated into existing skills | `/plugin install skill-reviewer@agentics-kit` |
| [`code-simplifier`](./kit/plugins/code-simplifier) | 1.0.2 | 2026-05-29 | Structural analysis covered by `code-review` | `/plugin install code-review@agentics-kit` |

**To load a removed plugin locally:**

```bash
# Example — load agent-creator for local use
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/agent-creator

# Load multiple, mixing active marketplace plugins with archived ones
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/code-review \
       --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/agent-creator
```

> Re-registering any of these plugins in `marketplace.json` requires explicit confirmation — see the [Removed Plugins registry](./.claude/rules/marketplace.md) for the removal rationale before proceeding.

### Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/issues/new) with:

- Plugin name and version
- Claude Code CLI version (`claude --version`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages or screenshots

### Creating a New Plugin

**Step 1: Scaffold the directory structure**

```
kit/plugins/my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: name, description (NO version field)
├── commands/                 # Slash commands — optional
│   └── my-command.md
├── skills/                   # Auto-activated skills — optional
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── agents/                   # Background subagent definitions — optional
│   └── my-agent.md
└── README.md
```

**Step 2: Create the plugin manifest**

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "What this plugin does"
}
```

> **Version rule:** `version` belongs **only** in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Adding it to `plugin.json` silently overrides the marketplace version and causes conflicts.

**Step 3: Test locally**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./kit/plugins/my-plugin

# Inside the session, test your commands/skills:
# /my-plugin:my-command
# "Invoke my-plugin on this file"
```

**Step 4: Register in the marketplace**

Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "git-subdir",
    "url": "https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics.git",
    "path": "kit/plugins/my-plugin"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this plugin does",
  "category": "development",
  "tags": ["specific", "relevant", "tags"]
}
```

**Available categories:** `development` · `testing` · `productivity` · `security` · `documentation` · `learning`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Build and test your plugin locally with `--plugin-dir`
3. Bump the plugin's `version` in `marketplace.json` (must be higher than `main`)
4. Include the relevant plan file from `docs/plans/` in your commit
5. Submit a PR with a clear description

**PR Checklist:**

- [ ] `plugin.json` has `name` and `description` — **no `version` field**
- [ ] Version bumped in `marketplace.json` and higher than version on `main`
- [ ] Plugin tested locally with `claude --plugin-dir`
- [ ] `README.md` included in plugin directory
- [ ] Homepage URL points to the plugin directory: `https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/tree/main/kit/plugins/my-plugin`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated (for existing plugins)
- [ ] Plan file committed alongside changes

### Versioning

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| **PATCH** `x.y.Z` | Bug fix, typo, metadata correction |
| **MINOR** `x.Y.z` | New command, skill, agent, or hook added |
| **MAJOR** `X.y.z` | Removing/renaming a command/skill/agent, changing argument format |

**Commit message conventions:**

```
fix(kit/plugins/my-plugin): bump version to 1.0.1     # patch
feat(kit/plugins/my-plugin): bump version to 1.1.0    # minor
feat(kit/plugins/my-plugin)!: bump version to 2.0.0   # major
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.

## Development

### Authoring Rules

Detailed patterns live in `.claude/rules/`:

| File | Scope | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| `plugin-patterns.md` | `kit/plugins/**` | Command/skill patterns, progressive disclosure, pitfalls |
| `marketplace.md` | global | Categories, tagging, versioning, registration |
| `testing.md` | `tests/**` | Test fixture guidelines |
| `plan-hygiene.md` | `**/plans/**` | Pre-commit plan file rename checks |
| `skill-authoring.md` | global | Skill description format, `allowed-tools`, trigger phrases |

### Project Hooks (Auto-Active)

Three hooks run automatically after every file Write/Edit:

1. **JSON validation** — validates `marketplace.json` syntax
2. **Uncommitted plan warning** — alerts if plan files are unstaged alongside plugin changes
3. **Version guard** — checks that the plugin version was bumped when `marketplace.json` was modified

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the demo test suite
bash tests/demo/run.sh

# Run the docs/pages smoke tests
bash tests/pages/test-docs-hub.sh
bash tests/pages/test-root-redirect.sh

# Check fixture validity
ls tests/fixtures/valid-plugin/
```

### Browsing Docs Online

The docs landing hub is deployed to GitHub Pages at [shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics](https://shawn-sandy.github.io/agentics/) and links to the Plans gallery and Social Media card gallery.

### Browsing Docs Locally

Two ways to serve the HTML galleries (`docs/plans/` and `docs/media/social/`) locally. The root `docs/index.html` is a landing hub with cards linking to each gallery:

**Script — auto-selects a free port:**

```bash
bash scripts/serve-docs.sh
# Plans gallery:  http://localhost:<port>/plans/
# Media library:  http://localhost:<port>/media/social/
```

Pass an explicit port as the first argument to pin it:

```bash
bash scripts/serve-docs.sh 8900
```

**Launch configs — auto-assigned ports (`.claude/launch.json`):**

Each config uses `autoPort: true`, so the preview harness binds a free port at start time (reported when the server launches) — no fixed port to collide with another running server.

| Config | Directory |
|--------|-----------|
| `plans-gallery` | `docs/plans/` |
| `media-library` | `docs/media/social/` |
| `docs-all` | `docs/` (landing hub at root) |

## Distribution

Plugin releases are published daily to [shawn-sandy/agentics-kit](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics-kit) — a clean, plugin-only distribution repository containing only the installable plugin files with no development scaffolding, test fixtures, or internal tooling.

**Install from the distribution repo:**

```
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentics-kit
```

**Repository roles:**

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `shawn-sandy/agentics` | Development workspace — full source, tests, plans, CI, and authoring tooling |
| `shawn-sandy/agentics-kit` | Clean distribution — plugin files only, built and published by the daily publish workflow |

**Publish workflow:** [publish-dist.yml](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/agentics/actions/workflows/publish-dist.yml) — runs daily and pushes the current `kit/plugins/` contents to `shawn-sandy/agentics-kit`.

**Trigger a manual publish:**

```bash
gh workflow run publish-dist.yml --repo shawn-sandy/agentics
```

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `claude.yml` | `@claude` mention in issues/PRs | Respond to questions and implement requested changes |
| `claude-code-review.yml` | PR opened / synchronized / reopened | Automated code review as PR comments |
| `deploy-pages.yml` | Push to `main` (docs changes) | Deploy `docs/` to GitHub Pages |
| `update-readme.yml` | Every Sunday at 00:00 UTC | Keep the README in sync with `marketplace.json` |

To trigger Claude in any issue or PR comment, mention `@claude`:

```
@claude Can you review the skill descriptions in this plugin?
```
