Stage all changes, create a conventional commit message, then push. Follow these steps in strict order. **STOP immediately after step 5.**

## When not to use

Does not create PRs — use pr-agent for that. Never pushes the default branch.

## Delegated invocation

Step 5 exists for a user who invoked this skill directly. **When another skill or agent invokes this skill as a sub-step, stop after Step 4** — never push.

The caller owns the push in that case (`ship-autonomous` Step 4 delegates to `pr-agent`; its Step 6d pushes directly). Pushing here would get ahead of the caller: `pr-agent` rebases an unpushed branch onto its base before pushing, and an early push would force that rebase into a merge.

## Step 0: Exit Plan Mode

**If in plan mode**, call `ExitPlanMode` first — this workflow mutates state.

## Step 1: Guards

Run `git status --porcelain` to check repository state.

- **Clean working tree** (empty output): output "Nothing to commit — working tree is clean." and **STOP**.
- **Detached HEAD** (`git branch --show-current` returns empty): output "Cannot commit: repository is in detached HEAD state. Checkout a branch first." and **STOP**.

## Step 2: Stage Changes

Run `git add -A` to stage all changes.

This trusts `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive or generated files. The user is responsible for `.gitignore` correctness.

## Step 3: Analyze Diff and Write Commit Message

Run `git diff --staged` to inspect all staged changes.

Write a conventional commit message:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Rules:**
- Total length: ≤ 72 characters
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`
- Scope: the most-changed top-level directory (e.g., `plugins/git-agent` → `plugins/git-agent`)
- Omit scope entirely if changes span more than 2 top-level directories
- Description: imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period

**Examples:**
- `feat(plugins/git-agent): add commit-agent and pr-agent skills`
- `fix(plugins/code-review): correct activation trigger wording`
- `chore: update marketplace.json with new plugin entry`

## Step 4: Commit

Run:
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```

Output the commit hash and message on success.

**If a pre-commit hook fails:** report the hook's output verbatim and **STOP**. Do not retry. Do not use `--no-verify`. Do not modify the staged files. Let the user fix the issue.

**If the lint gate blocks the commit** (the output starts with ``Blocked: `<check>` failed, so this commit was not created.``), git-agent's own lint hook stopped it, not a git hook. Nothing was committed and the changes are still staged. Never switch the gate off to get past it: do not create `.claude/no-lint-gate` or edit `.claude/lint-gate.json`, even though the block message offers the first. That is the user's call.

- **Delegated invocation:** report "Lint gate blocked the commit. Nothing committed; changes are still staged." followed by the block output verbatim, and **STOP**. The caller owns the fix.
- **Direct invocation:** use **AskUserQuestion** with the header `Lint gate`, the question "The lint gate blocked this commit. Fix the reported failures and retry?", and two options:
  - **Fix and retry**: follow the fix loop below.
  - **Stop**: output "Nothing committed. Changes are still staged." and **STOP**.

Fix loop: fix only failures in files listed by `git diff --staged --name-only`, with the smallest edit that clears each one, changing nothing else. A reported failure in a file this commit does not touch is not this commit's to fix: report the block output verbatim and **STOP** without editing. Otherwise stage only the files the fix edited, with `git add -- <file>...` (not `-A`, which would sweep in anything saved since Step 2), and re-run the commit above with the same message. Ask once and fix at most twice; if the gate blocks a third time, report its latest output verbatim and **STOP**. Once the commit lands, list the files the fix edited.

After a successful commit, output one line:

> To undo: `git reset HEAD~1`

## Step 5: Push

Do not ask — push as soon as the commit lands.

**If the current branch is the default branch**, output "On `<current-branch>`, the default branch — commit left local. Push it yourself if you meant to." and **STOP**. Read the default live with `git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD`: it is the `refs/heads/<name>` on the `ref:` line. Not the cached `origin/HEAD`, which `git fetch` never updates, so it goes stale when the remote renames its default. `main` and `master` always count too. **If the default cannot be determined** (the command fails or prints no `ref:` line), output "Could not read origin's default branch — commit left local." and **STOP**. Nobody approves this push, so it never targets the default branch.

Otherwise run:
```
git push -u origin <current-branch>
```

Always name the branch; never push without arguments. A branch cut from `origin/main` tracks `origin/main`, so an argument-less push would either fail (`push.default=simple`) or land on the base branch (`push.default=upstream`). Naming the branch pushes it to its own name and sets its upstream either way. Report the result.

**If the push fails** (rejected, no remote, auth failure, pre-push hook), report the error verbatim and **STOP**. Do not retry. Do not force. Do not pull, fetch, rebase, or merge to make the push succeed — a rejected push means the branch diverged, and reconciling it is the user's call.

**STOP here. Do not run tests, analyze coverage, check for issues, create PRs, or take any further action.**
